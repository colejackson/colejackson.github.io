Last night I woke up at around 2 in the morning in a code sweat.  
This happenes every now and again to all of us, just some anxiety
playing out in my dreams probably.

Anyway, I couldn't get back to sleep so I decided to work on the app
project I had started the other day.  It was crazy how much more
clearly I worked on just a couple hours sleep, because I finished
my first custom Android app last night.

The app reads GPS coordinates, and can also make a text file logging
a set of GPS tags relating to a given area.  This is part of the
AR Text Based Game SACM is planning to do next semester.

I am starting to realize how much more efficiently I can workwith GitHub
involved.  I am planning a number of big projects: the AR game, updates
to the lab database, work on sorting algorithm visualizations, arcade
cabinet handlers, and not to mention the website that I already have to
keep up (knock on wood).  It is a lot, but with the right tools I know
I can surmount it.

I'm gonna go get a bite and do some schoolwork, more later.
